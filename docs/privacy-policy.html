        <h2>3. Permissions We Request</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Camera Permission</h3>
        <p>
            The App requests camera permission to allow you to take photos to accompany your poop logs. Photos are stored securely and are only accessible to you and, if you choose to share them, members of groups you've joined. You can revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings, though this will disable the photo-taking feature.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Notifications Permission</h3>
        <p>
            The App requests notification permission to send you push notifications about group activities, friend requests, and other app-related updates. You can manage notification preferences in the App settings or through your device settings.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is stored securely using Supabase, a cloud database service. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Photos you take are stored in secure cloud storage and are associated with your account. Photos are only accessible to you and group members you explicitly share them with.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Supabase</h3>
        <p>
            We use Supabase to store and manage your data. Supabase processes your data in accordance with their privacy policy. Your data is stored in secure databases with encryption at rest and in transit.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Adapty</h3>
        <p>
            We use Adapty to manage premium subscriptions and in-app purchases. Adapty processes payment information and subscription data in accordance with their privacy policy. We do not store your payment information directly.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Push Notifications</h3>
        <p>
            Push notifications are delivered through Expo's notification service. Device tokens are stored securely and used solely for delivering notifications you've opted into.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Correct inaccurate or incomplete data</li>

        <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>

            We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal information, except where we are required to retain it for legal purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
